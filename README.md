## About Website
This is a courier delivery website with six different services in the offering.
* A normal user can browse through the website and look at all the services they have. 
* However, a user needs to sign in to be able to see the service details of any particular service and make any order. 
* After signing in, the user will be able to see more options like, My Orders, Order Management, etc. 
* I have kept google sign in for now as the only way to log in to the website. 
* After going to the specific service, if the user wants to order that service, then he/she has to provide some extra details like his address and phone number. 
* User will be able to add service to the services section from the Add Services page.
* User will be able to delete services only after logging in
